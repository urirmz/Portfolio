  Unary (can only be used in integral types)
    ~ 
      The trick to find out the result of applying the ~ operator is to just multiply the input with -1 and subtract 1. 
      For example, ~8 will be 8*-1 - 1 i.e. -9. Similarly, ~-9 will be -9*-1 - 1 i.e. 8.

Concatenate operator "+"
  If either one of its two operators is a string, 
    converts the other operand to a string and produces a new string joining the two
    1. If the non-string operand is a reference variable, its toString() method is invoked
    2. If the non-string operand is a primitive variable, 
      a wrapper object of the same type is created using the primitive value, 
      then toString() is invoked on the wrapper object
    3. If one of the operands is a null, string "null" is used instead

Expressions vs statements
  Statements
    Complete line of code that may or may not have a value of its own
  Expressions
    Combination of one or more explicit values, constants, variables, operators and functions
      that the programming language interprets and computes to produce another value
    All expressions have a value
  Expression statements
    Generally, expressions by themselves do not form a valid line of code, however some expressions,
      namely assignment expressions, pre/post-increment/decrement instance creations and method invocations,
      are explicitly allowed by Java to be valid statements. They are called a expression statement

Associativity
  Most of the operators in Java are defined to be left-associative,
    notable exceptions are assignment operators, ternary operator, lambda and switch expression

instanceof as a pattern matching
  In Java 16, the instanceof operator was enhanced to reduce boilerplate code,
    allowing flow-scoped variables with instanceof
  Example
    Object obj = getObject();
    if (obj instanceof String str) {
      System.out.println("String length is " + str.length());
    } else if (obj instanceof Integer ival) {
      System.out.println("Hex value is " + Integer.toHexString(ival));
    }
  Deconstructing records
    Since records are defined with precise rules about their fields and accessor,
      they are easy to deconstruct using pattern matching
    Example
      void main() {
        record Student(int id, String name) {}
        Object obj = new Student(1, "Bob");
        if (obj instanceof Student(int i, String n)) {
          System.out.println("Id = " + i + " Name = " + n);
        }
      }
    Deconstruction of records can be done even when they are nested inside another record
      Example
      void main() {
        record Address(String value) {}
        record Student(int id, String name, Address address) {}
        Object obj = new Student(1, "Bob", new Address("123 Main St"));
        if (obj instanceof Student(int i, String n, Address(var value))) {
          System.out.println(value); // Prints 123 Main St
        }
      }
      
Dangling else
  Is a well known problem in programming languages that have if and else statements
    int value = 3;
    if(value == 0)
    if(value == 1) System.out.prntln(b)
    else System.out.println("c");
  The question here is with which if should the else be associated?
    The Java solution: the else is to be associated to the nearest if

Switch 
  Can be used as a statement or as an expression (remember expressions hold values)
  Can use the new or the old syntax
  The switch selector must not be a long, float, double or boolean
  If you use null in a switch label, it must be used before the default label,
    and the switch statement must be exhaustive,
    A null value does not match the default label, only matches the null label
  Case label must be assignable to the type of the selector,
    for example, if selector is type byte, labels cannot have a value larger than byte
  There can be at most one default block on a switch statement, which is optional
  switch expressions
    Must be exhaustive, which means it must cover all cases
    In the old syntax, they require a yield statement
    Are allowed to return different type of values from different paths of execution
  Pattern matching
    After Java 21, switch can use pattern matching
      switch(obj) {
        case Integer i -> System.out.println("Integer " + i);
        case Double d -> System.out.println("Double " + d);
        default -> System.out.println("Object " + obj);
      }
    Switch with pattern matching must be exhaustive
    The fall through behavior is not allowed
    The default label must not have a pattern variable
  Guards
    Case labels can now be guarded with values
      switch(obj) {
        case Integer i when i < 0 -> System.out.println("Negative value");
        case Integer i when i >= 0 -> System.out.println("Positive value");
        default -> System.out.println("Object " + obj);
      }
